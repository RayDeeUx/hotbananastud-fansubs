00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.360
"It's really hard to <i>not</i> offend anyone these days."

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.650
And <i>that</i> was in 2009.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.720
[CHUCKLES]

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome back to class, everyone,
where I'm gonna teach you how to...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.960
[EVERYONE]
Act like we mean it.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.000
That's right!
Now let's start with some warm-ups.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.400
"Hi, I'm Alex Rimmer.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480
and if you want to be famous,
then <i>you're</i> gonna need <i>me</i>.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.440
I know the ins and outs of
being a successful actor,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.600
and with my help,
you'll be famous in no time."

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.400
12 years ago, I was the star of a documentary about
my illustrious career in teaching college theater.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.560
And even though the internet gobbled it up,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.880
I am living proof that fame
does not always equal fortune.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.250
'Cause after all these years,
I'm still here, teaching

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.700
students how to look their best on camera.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.520 position:100% line:7.5%
At the Alex Rimmer Screen Acting Class,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520
I'll teach you your good angles,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.040
your bad angles,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.600
and what your typecast is.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.200
What do you see when you look at this?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
[STUDENTS]
Too tall.             Registered.
Boring.               Depressed!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.680
My students love me.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.480
[SUCKY STUDENT]
You're cheap and ugly,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.000
[SUCKY STUDENT]
and you are a <i>fraud!</i>

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
All right, hold.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.480
Can anyone tell me why
that delivery sucked so much?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.760
[SUCKY STUDENT]
I'm doing my best.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.600
That's your opinion.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.800
Guys, why does she suck?

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.520
[COSPLAYER]
Is this where the cosplay class is?

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840
That's at 12 o'clock, Mr. Lipton.
I got this space for another 20 minutes.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.360
[MR. LIPTON THE COSPLAYER]
But I was told Cosplay Club was here.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.000
I need you to leave.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.700
[MR. LIPTON THE COSPLAYER]
Augh, come on.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.440
Get the [kucf] out.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.040
[MR. LIPTON THE COSPLAYER]
Give me a break!

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.120
God damn it, <i>get out!</i>

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.240
[MR. LIPTON THE COSPLAYER]
To hell with you, I'm out of here.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.600
Do I enjoy teaching people how to act?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.160
I enjoy teaching people how to <i>behave</i>, and that's
all acting really is: it's just manufactured behavior.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.240
All right, drop it in the Device Dungeon, kiddo.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.500
My mom's in the hospital.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
And you're about to join her.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.040
It's so easy for Gen Z to get distracted,
so it's my job to keep 'em focused.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.960
Keep reading, actors don't notice the critics.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.600
Who is thou, sweetest—

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.840
<i>{b o n k}</i>

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.200
[SUCKY STUDENT]
I think I know why I suck.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.760
Why is that?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.300
[SUCKY STUDENT]
Those people in the back, they've been watching us,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.400
[SUCKY STUDENT]
and I don't think they've paid for this class.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.920
Hey freeloaders, you wanna
get the [kcuf] out now plea—

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.200
...whenever you feel like getting the [kcuf] out?...

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.520
Okay, everyone else, get the [kcuf] out now!

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.160
Get out.
<i>Now</i>, or I'll shoot up this whole God damn—

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.280
Thank you for your money.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.360
Thank you for your time.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.720
Which one could argue is considerably more
valuable these days, so let's make this fast.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840
My name is Victor Ball.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.200
Holy [tihs].

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.640
Wait, <i>the</i> Victor B— as in—

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.100
Ball Pictures, yes.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.320
It's the largest media empire in Hollywood.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960
You can't chop that with whipped cream.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.200
[VICTOR BALL]
We're very rich.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440
[LILLIAN BALL]
And lucky you, we need your help.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.480
[VICTOR BALL]
It's our son.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.600
Daddy, I have fantastic news.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.160
Son, we're in the middle of business.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.120
I finished my movie,
and I'm ready for you to make it.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.840
No, no, no— don't clap for that.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920
My son has very poor taste.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.960
Make my movie, make my movie, make my movie!!!!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.400
[LILLIAN BALL]
This movie is garbage.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.000
[VICTOR BALL]
I know, dear.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.760
[LILLIAN BALL]
Does he actually think we'll finance this?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.440
[LILLIAN BALL]
What would that say about us?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.160
[VICTOR BALL]
That we raised a lousy writer?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.900
[LILLIAN BALL]
Well, we did.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.040
[VICTOR BALL]
They were <i>your</i> eggs.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.200
[LILLIAN BALL]
That was <i>your</i> semen!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
[COMMERCIAL JINGLE]

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.160
[COMMERCIAL]
"Well, hey there, I can make
anything look good on camera."

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.400
[VICTOR BALL]
Then the idea came to me.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.100
[COMMERCIAL]
"Now let's talk about my prices."

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.600
[VICTOR BALL]
Why would we pay for a whole production
when we could just pay for you?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
[LILLIAN BALL]
We need you to make our son's movie.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.680
Okay, but this script is– it's pure caca.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.300
I mean, Netflix wouldn't touch this with a pole.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.700
That's what we told him, and he just said to us...

[dekcuf]

!00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.520
YOU IN A PAINT STORE

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.680
I mean, what audience is this even for?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.120
[PRESTON BALL]
It's for everyone!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.840
[RIMMER]
Mr. Ball, no one in their
right mind would make this movie.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.300
[PRESTON BALL]
And that's why you're going to.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.560
[VICTOR BALL]
And that's why you're going to.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.600
[LILLIAN BALL]
Haven't you been teaching long enough, Alex?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.080
[MR. LIPTON THE COSPLAYER]
I'll do what I want and I'll be who I want!

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.320
Okay, uh, you know, let's take
this into my office. Let's go.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.440
I mean, I'll need to find crew, sets, costumes.
You want me to pull all of this off without a budget?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.380
You'll find a way. You can't afford
not to, your life's too shitty.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.720
Mr. Ball, it's not that simple.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.800
Find a way, then call us when you do.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.175
Luckily, one of my former students
happens to be a movie director.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.760
[Kcuf] him harder, god dammit!

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.925
I've been directing adult films,
basically, since the end of theater class.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.000
I give my uncle more more than that! Harder!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.400
<i>{s p l a t}</i>

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.040
[YELPS]

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.920
Too hard!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.660
What can I say? I love cinema.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.840
God damn it, who's gonna clean this up?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.160
Look what you did to Dennis!
Do you think twinks grow on trees around he–

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.960
Um... yeah. Uh, take... five, everyone.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.850
And that better be done
bleeding by the time I get back.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.880
Jaime Bolton.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.960
After all these years.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.840
Wow.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.000
You don't look like you've eaten since I've seen you.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.160
You look like you have.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.920
Homophobe.

0:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.650
Homosexual.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.920
I need help.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.240
This script is garbage.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.100
I know, yeah.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.760
But I've been wanting to direct
something with a bigger budget, so...

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.000
You said his parents are rich?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.500
They– yeah, but I don't think
they're gonna pay much for this.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.680
Well, I'm not directing this
shit unless you get me a budget.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.640
A budget of what?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.200
Money.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.720
Damn it.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.680
And you're gonna need a cast, which means <i>you</i>
need to find <i>actors</i> willing to <i>say</i> this dialogue.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.200
[MASON]
And we're dophins, and we are dolphins.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.300
And we're dophins, and we are dolphins.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.840
We are being dolphins, people!

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.760
Felicity, have you ever <i>seen</i> a <i>dolphin</i>?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.840
No?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.280
[MASON]
...okay.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.280
[RIMMER]
What the [kcuf], bruh? Like, <i>our</i> teacher
thinks <i>this</i> is gonna help us be actors?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.960
[MASON]
Everyone, halt.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.280
[MASON]
We have a student who didn't pay for this class.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.680
[RIMMER]
Please, like you ever paid for any of mine!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.320
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
I didn't mind it though. You know,
Mason was always my best student.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.200
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
In fact, taking my class inspired
him to become a teacher himself.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.280
[UNNAMED STUDENT]
Um, isn't that the guy the school
said to stay away from if we see him?

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.600
[RIMMER]
That doesn't even look like me.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.600
Look, Mason, I need your help with something.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.640
Of course. You're the whole reason I have this job.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.200
I'd do anything for you.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.560 position:100% line:7.5%
Absolutely not, this script is [gnikcuf] garbage.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.280
Mason, I just need a few actors.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.120
So you came here to poach <i>my</i> students?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.750
It's not my fault; college kids say yes
to everything. Isn't that right, guys?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.520
If they're interested, let them read
the script and decide for themselves.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.900
All right guys, what do you think?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.640
OKAY, OKAY! I <i>KNOW</i> IT'S BAD!

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.440
NEVER BRING TEXT LIKE THAT ONTO THIS CAMPUS <i>AGAIN!</i>

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.000
Everybody spit on him!

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.800
Hey! Alex.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.920
Oh, more trash!

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.120
What is– what the [kcuf] is this?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.440
You remember Linda and Dean Shaft?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.400
Those were their names.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.100
Well, they're influencers now.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100
I'm Lindy!

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.400
And I'm Shafty!

And we're just a couple of
college kids trying to get through life!

NOTE
BELOW LINES ARE FOR OTHER LANGUAGES
!00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.200
I'm 26 years old!

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.200
My students showed me some of the content they create,
and by the looks of it, they'll do anything.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.240
Well, they should be here any second now, so...

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.560
You know, fun fact:
they actually used to hate each other.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.680
And now they're working with each other! How about—

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.840
WHAT THE [KCUF]!

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840
That was good. Now, do it realistic.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840
That <i>was</i> real!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.520
[SHAFT]
Yeah, real <i>lackluster</i>.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.140
[LINDA]
No, it's perfect. Look!

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.680
[RIMMER]
Don't post that!

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.320
[LINDA]
It's done.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.160
[SHAFT]
It's viral!

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.480
[RIMMER]
It's not even funny.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.720
[STRANGER]
Hah! It's you!

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.920
There's no setup, there's no
context, it's all just punchline!

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.520
That's what people want now, dude.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.520
There's no time for plot or narrative.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.750
Well, that's stupid.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.920
That's like having sex with just the orga—

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.400
Well, actually...

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.000
I need money.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.360
So is that a yes?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.640
You don't think <i>we</i> have money, do you?

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.440
Well, I do. You— Aren't you two
TikTokin' your way to the top?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.760
I am TikTelling you that we are woke and broke.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.120
Damn it.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.600
But you know who does have money, right?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.680
No. Absolutely not.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.200
Karen.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.080
Ratatata.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.500
She's rich, and she's the only one of us who is.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.720
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
You try sleeping knowing that
a goblin is your last resort.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.200
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
And the more I tried denying it to myself...

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.720
(KAREN)
Mr. Rimmer, help!!!!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.040
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
...the more she got under my skin.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.200
(KAREN)
I had salmon for lunch.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.000
Thank you all for being here tonight.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.400
[JAIME]
You said you'd pay us to be here.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.100
Not in writing.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.840
Look, guys, I'm trying to get money from Karen.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.360
[EVERYONE]
But she hates you.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.840
Yes, I know that.
Thank you for that.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.080
But she might listen to you guys,
which is why I'm asking you to—

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.520
[MASON]
Help you ask her for money?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.760
Is that a crime, Mason?

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.480
[LINDA]
Well, what's in it for us, Mr. Rimmer?

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.760
Aww! You still call me "mister".

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.640
[LINDA]
Well, how else do you say your first name, dummy?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.200
Yeah? Okay...

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.120
Look, I'll give you each a role in this movie,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.280
and if Karen invests as much as I'm hoping she will,
you could all have a pretty penny in your pocket by Christmas.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.500
[SHAFT]
I'm in! You had me at money.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.960
Good. Now, I did a bit of a deep dive
on Karen's current situation.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.400
Turns out she became a well-published
author with some bullshit bestseller

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.800
called "[Kcuf] Acting Teachers: Why
They Are Overpaid and Also Should Die".

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.560 position:100% line:7.5%
She sold enough copies to
outright buy the god damn college—

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.560 position:100% line:7.5%
[KAREN]
This is Karen Land, where no one is allowed.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.200 position:100% line:7.5%
[KAREN]
Get the [kcuf] out! Go!

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.360 position:100% line:7.5%
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
—as a way of reclaiming all of
her bad memories from that place.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.160
[MASON]
Hold on. We know all this.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.480
No, you d– wait, how?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.000
[EVERYONE]
Google.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.400
[Kcuf].

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.680
[JAIME]
Did you know she got married to Kaden?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.800
What? No, wait, hold on, I need
to add this to the board!

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.720
[JAIME]
But it didn't last long. They hated each other.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.680
Okay, wait, hold on, "they hated each other"...

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.360
[MASON]
And after she made her first million,
she said, "I'm leaving you, Kaden."

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.680
[MASON]
And he was like, "What?! But I
got a tattoo for you, bitch!"

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.300
[JAIME]
Then she was like, "Well, this pussy's
bouncing off to find a man with income."

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.200
[MASON]
She had him sent to prison for
assaulting her hand with his face.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.880
[MASON]
She's more lethal now than ever before.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.840
[MASON]
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.880
[JAIME]
Yeah, she is in a wheelchair because of you.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.680
Still?

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.320
[MASON]
What part of "permanently
paralyzed" is confusing to you?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.920
It's been 12 years, Mason.
She can call it a wheelchair, I call it a choice.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920
[LINDA]
That's offensive.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.200
[JAIME]
One day, he's gonna open his
mouth and get himself <i>shot</i>.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.500
[RIMMER]
No!

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.240
[RIMMER]
Well, it looks like this is the place.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.400
[MASON]
What gave it away?

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.720
[LINDA]
It gives you chills, doesn't it?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.100
[GOON]
Hello.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.900
[GOON]
She's been expecting you.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.320
[RIMMER]
There she is! How you doin', Kare Bear?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.500
[KAREN]
Wow.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.080
[KAREN]
You brought the whole gang to me.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.560
[LINDA]
Well, we all just missed you so much!

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.360
[JAIME]
Yeah, and we were just talking about how sorry
we are about laughing at you all the time,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.120
[JAIME]
and your dead mom, and your weird feet, and
your bad acting, and your acne all the time,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.800
[MASON]
Guys, are we getting locked in?

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.320
[KAREN]
I've been waiting for this
moment for 12 goddamn years.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.480
[RIMMER]
I really hope you're acting right now, because
Karen, this is the performance of a lifetime.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.600
[KAREN]
<i>SHUT UP!</i>

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.240
[SADISTIC CHUCKLE]

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.520
[KAREN]
I'm going to enjoy doing

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.000
[SHAFT]
Scatter!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.200
[KAREN]
Son of a bitch.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.700
[JAIME]
I [gnikcuf] called it, right?!

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.100
[KAREN]
Oh, [tihs].

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.200
[MORTICIAN]
Today we celebrate the life and legacy of Karen Shou,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.500
[MORTICIAN]
with all of the friends and family she left behind.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.040
[MORTICIAN]
May you rest in peace knowing you
were cremated at the Maribel Morgue,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.920
[MORTICIAN]
where the service is so nice,
you'll wanna die twice.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.100
[RIMMER]
Hi, excuse me. What happens to her money?

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.700
[MORTICIAN]
What?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.520
[RIMMER]
Her fortune, dumbass. Where does it go?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.800
[MORTICIAN]
You'll have to talk to a lawyer about that.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.640
[LINDA]
UGH, then why the [kcuf] are we here?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.280
[MORTICIAN]
I will go anywhere I'm paid.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.150
[JAIME]
Then why don't you go to Hell!

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.480
<i>{t h u m p}</i>

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160
[MORTICIAN]
Jesus!

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.640
[LAWYER]
Well, I hate to be a bad news-bearer, Mr. [Mir]job...

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.000
[RIMMER]
It's "Rim<i>mer</i>".

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.040
[LAWYER]
It looks like Karen liquidated all her assets
and spent everything she had on this college.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.560
[SHAFT]
Well, I know what we gotta do.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.480
[SHAFT]
We gotta burn this place down.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.080
[EVERYONE]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.100
[LAWYER]
She <i>did</i> leave behind...

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.650
[LAWYER]
...this.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.480
[MASON]
What the hell is that?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.480
[LAWYER]
Beats me with a hammer.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.725
[LAWYER]
All I know is, it can only be opened
with her husband's fingerprint.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.800
Hey [elohssa], your dead wife left this behind
and I need your fingerprint to open it.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.500
Bail me out and I'll open your box.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.760
No deal.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.800
I don't care how low your bail is set.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.550
I will see to it that you rot in here
where you belong, you piece of sh—

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.800 position:100% line:7.5%
All right, now open this.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.800
I'm gonna need a ride to town first.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.200
God damn you. Like I would be dumb enough
to let you alone in my car with me—

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.600 position:100% line:7.5%
All right, now open this.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.280
We're in the middle of nowhere, dick. I'm not touching
that thing until you at least drop me off downtown.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.700
I wouldn't drop you off at a goddamn
Arby's 'til you open this thing.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560
Thank you.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.040
It also came with this.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.800
What's that?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.300
[SCREAMS]

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.000
You piece of shit!

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.180
[KCUF]!

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400
[MASON]
Well?

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.000
It was nothing.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.360
[LINDA]
Well, it was worth a try.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm still willing to do this if you are, okay?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.800
We don't need a big budget to make a movie.
We don't even need a little bit of money.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.040
I mean, look at all the things
we did back when we were still broke.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.320
[MASON]
But you're <i>still</i> broke.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.400
Exactly, which is why I'm hoping you'll help me.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.040
[RIMMER]
Well, it looks like I'm doing this on my own.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.560
[RIMMER]
I don't have a budget, and I don't have a crew,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.520
[RIMMER]
but I am determined to do whatever it
takes to make your son's movie happen.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.250
[VICTOR BALL]
Good.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.520
[VICTOR BALL]
So when are you scheduled to arrive?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:20.940
What?

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.080
[LILLIAN BALL]
Well, in Los Angeles, of course.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.280
[LILLIAN BALL]
As executive producer, our son is gonna
want to keep a close eye on your production.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.760
[VICTOR BALL]
I'll let you pitch any movie
you want to my company.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:38.320
[VICTOR BALL]
Any story you want to make, any role you
want to play. It's yours, if you help my son.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.800
[RIMMER]
What choice do I have?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:42.000
[RIMMER]
I need this.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.300
Well, I mean, I guess I can move some things
around in my schedule, but it's not gonna be easy.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.200
[Tihs]!

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:48.800
[Gnikcuf]...

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.400
Too big!

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.700
Too big— you're too big!

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.240
I need a ride home.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.720
You know I'm <i>literally</i> about to
drive to Los Angeles right now.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.600
That's what I was hoping for.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.640
RIMMER: But—
JAIME: I want to direct this movie.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.400
[RIMMER]
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't direct
this movie unless I had a budget.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.280
[JAIME]
I'm watching a man give the full circumference
of his hole to a movie that'll never fly.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.080
[JAIME]
There's no budget that can
match that kind of desperation.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.360
[RIMMER]
You really wanna put your faith in me.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.320
[JAIME]
You remember our last day of class?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.320
[RIMMER]
We never had a last day of class. The school
ran out of funds before the semester ended.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.920
[JAIME (V.O.)]
But that didn't stop you from making sure
that we all spent one last day together.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.960
(KADEN)
He's not coming.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.320
(MASON)
Calm down, he'll be here.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.560

Tough words from an old hag.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.520
(LINDA)
If I'm such an old hag,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.525
(LINDA)
then how's it that I still fit in this
button-up that I wore when I was 9?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.520
(RIMMER)
This is the last time I'll probably see these
people, so of course it has to be special.

You didn't have to
see us again, but you wanted to,

because we were more than a job,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.400
(RIMMER)
Hey, how much to bang all of you?
Do I get a group discount?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400
[JAIME (V.O.)]
more than a class.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.400

So now it's time to repay the favor, 'kay?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.960
Slow, slow.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.960
I'm going slow!

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.800
God damn it, you're gonna <i>break MY CAR</i>!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:15.680
[RIMMER AND JAIME (singing)]
Going to LA, we're going to LA,
and I'm really excited, and nothing can stop us now!
