[DESMOND]
Hey! Can you hear us?

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.040
[ELYSE]
Thaddeus!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.960
[JAIME]
We're right here!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.400
[THADDEUS]
I can hear you!

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.120
HELP!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.440
{RIMMER}
Well, it is our second week of class,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.240
and things are not going good.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.760
We combined all the money that the students
gave us and bought ourselves a camera,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.410
which, during our first scene...

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.200
(DESMOND)
"I might not be from this neighborhood,
but I know those girls..."

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.160
{RIMMER}
...got [tihs]canned immediately.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280
So you know what? Screw it,
we're shooting the whole thing iPhone style.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.680
Then Thaddeus thought it'd
be cool to ask if he could...

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.480
(THADDEUS)
â€”go to the bathroom?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.240
(JAIME)
If it's longer than two minutes, we'll know what's up!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.280
{RIMMER}
...but I should've told him
where the damn toilet was,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.360
'cause he took a right turn down the wrong hole
that the owner explicitly warned me about.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.600 position:100% line:7.5%
(RHODA MAY)
We don't even know where this goes.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500 position:100% line:7.5%
{RIMMER}
and now I've had a student stuck
in the walls for over three hours...

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.320
[THADDEUS]
How many days has it been?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720
[CLAIRE]
It's the same day.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.120
[DESMOND]
Can anyone tell where he is now?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.080
[THADDEUS]
Well, I don't feel like it!

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440
{RIMMER}
...and we got about two weeks
left to finish this thing.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.600

It's time to kill him with our vaginas!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320

That's what he gets for running out of chocolates.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.840
[JAIME]
Cut, cut. I'm not buying this.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
That's what I've been telling her.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.600
I was talking about you, Claire.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.240
[Tihs].

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
Your character is called "Hot Girl Demon",
and that is not a hot person's voice.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.160
Yeah, well, it's <i>my</i> voice.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.800
[RIMMER]
I get that, but now, just try it hotter, alright?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.680
Likeâ€” Elyse, say... anything.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.480
"Koala".

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.400
Yeah, see how she said that?
"Koala", like kind of a little sluttiness to it.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.160
[JAIME]
Ugh. Alex, can you just get up there
and show her how to slut?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.920
Alright, here. Claire, get out of the way,
I'm gonna be you for a sec.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.480
[CLAIRE]
You know I studied Groundlings
for three years, right?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.600
[DESMOND]
You went to Groundlings?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.720
Don't be an idiot.
I studied <i>about</i> the school.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.640
Okay. All right.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.240
Now I need you to look into that camera and say:

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.300
"I'm gonna make him come till he's dead!

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.160

[ELYSE]
What part of the script is this?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.760
This theater is the only thing
my grandmother left me,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.720
and you're defiling it with an acting class!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.360
[DESMOND]
I'm sorry, what's wrong with acting?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.840
Go look in the mirror, homo!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.960
Hey, my grandma's dying, bitch!

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.400
Ma'am, I swear to you, Mr. Rimmer is trying his best

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.120
to make us the heterosexuals
that God intended us to be.

I've financed HUNDREDS of films!

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.360
But have you ever sat behind a camera
and actually made creative choices?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.120
Have you ever spent your rent money on a project

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.200
because creating is <i>literally</i>
more important than your own needs?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200
HAVE <i>YOU?!</i>

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.080
No.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.400
But I am constantly around people
who have no other choice

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.080
but to express themselves as <i>loudly</i>
as possible, otherwise they'll explode.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.840
(CROMWELL)
"This video is for my girl Rhoda May."

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.720
"A baby right now,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.440
but a star one day."

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.600
"Lights up!"

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.240
"Our story begins with a..."

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.360
[KADEN (V.O.)]
There <i>are</i> people who actually enjoy making stuff,
and I've seen firsthand the effect that making art has on them,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.160
[KADEN (V.O.)]
and the way it moves people when they watch it,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.270
[KADEN (V.O.)]
and the way it brings them
together when they make it.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.280
[KADEN SCOFFS]

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.920
You're a businessman.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.680
And you have no right toying with the dreams of creatives
just because <i>you</i> never were one.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.640
(CROMWELL)
"Wherever you are, my sweetheart,
just know I love you very much."

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.800
"May you shine your brightest, and encourage
those around you to shine just as bright."

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.120
[KADEN (V.O.)]
But you wouldn't understand this feeling,
because you don't make movies, sir.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.400
[KADEN]
But you wouldn't understand this feeling,
because you don't make movies, sir.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.000
You make products.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.640
[PRESTON BALL]
What the FUCK did that
have to do with electricity?!

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.600
[RHODA MAY]
That theater was a place
my father could be himself.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.160
And I've been taking that away
from so many people...

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.130
[RIMMER]
Rhoda, it's not too late to
use your theater for good.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:28.960
And people come to an acting class because it's a safe place
for them to be themselves at the loudest possible volume.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.800
I've never been myself at a loud volume.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.400
Yeah.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.820
Yeah, you're- you're pretty quiet.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.120
So y'all making a movie?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.920
Well, only if you really think about it.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.080
I want a role in this movie.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.280
Well, here's the thing: we've already
cast the whole production...

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.920
[RHODA]
And you can use this whole building as a set!

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.820
Welcome to the cast!

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.000
[RHODA GIGGLES]

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.300
[RIMMER]
Guys, I got some good news:

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.600
Ricky and Rhoda May
have generously donated

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800
this whole building for us
to shoot all of our scenes in!

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.560
[MAZEY]
Oh, yeah!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.360
Now let's make you the best goddamn actors
this side of Mulholland Drive!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.560
[JAIME]
And- and let's get it all on camera!

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.100
Yeah!

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.800
We need to celebrate! Who wants pizza?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.520
Someone get an order going.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.680
I'm already on it!

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.780
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.950
[KADEN (V.O.)]
Part of me feels guilty letting him
do all this for nothing, but...

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.200
I mean, look at him.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.840
Would you tell a puppy they're getting put down?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.320
No.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.920
You just let them have their bone.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.360
{MAZEY}
So they tell me I'm dying,
and that really sucks.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.920
'Cause I really like this church
and all the people in it too.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.280
The pastor woman,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.760
the security guard,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.560
those possessed sisters,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.920
my cousin and the big baby.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.360
I'm the only one who sees
these people for who they are.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.200
Just like I'm the only one that saw who
loosened the stage lights that would fall.

Loosened what?
