"Help!"

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.650
[DEMONIC LAUGHTER]

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.400
"No!"

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.690
[DESMOND PANICS]

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.040
"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.720
[CLAIRE]
"You can't run from us, silly boy!"

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.500
"I don't have any more chocolate, okay?"

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.040
"And now you must pay with your LIFE..."

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.680
"<i>...and</i> your VIRGINITY!"

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.300
"Well, I don't have either to give."

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.600
"But I'm not afraid to battle a true demon."

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.100
"Well then, have you met..."

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.360
"...my sister?"

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.500
[MAZEY]
Which way is that toilet bowl again?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700
[JAIME]
Damn it, cut!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700
Mazey, what the [KCUF]
are you doing in my shot?!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.320
[CLAIRE]
I told you where the bathroom was
a MILLION times, Mazey!

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.480
Well, it's coming out.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.800
[RIMMER]
We need thicker fog!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.440
[THADDEUS]
Well, I'm gonna need a bigger vape!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.480
That's fantastic.
Where is Elyse, everyone?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.960
[CLAIRE]
She's out TikToking in the parking lot.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.500
[JAIME]
OH, THAT FUCKING BITCH!

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.880
I TOLD HER I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS FUCKING MILLENNIAL BULLSHIT!

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.200
{RIMMER}
Yes, I did know that Jamie was going to be
abusive to the actors when I asked him to direct,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.350
and, so far, yeah, he...

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.000
He has been.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.120
{RIMMER}
But the parking lot is a public place,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.560
and you just can't hit people in public.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.440
[RIMMER]
Elyse, sweetheart, you're up. Let's go!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.720
[ELYSE]
One sec, I'm almost done!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.560
I don't wanna hear it!
Get your ass into...

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560
Are you hitting yourself with a goddamn wrench?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.730
It's the Wrench Challenge,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.400
where you can see how hard you can take one!

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.700
Okay, first of all, that was weak.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
Secondly, I need you on your [gnikcuf] mark,
or I'm dropping you from my class,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.740
and I don't do refunds.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640
Do you want to be in this one with me?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.160
{RIMMER}
I've been trying to break into
the viral community for years,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440
so I'm in no position to
turn down a trend while it's still hot.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.100
{ELYSE}
There's no such thing
as the Wrench Challenge.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.360
I just love seeing what
other people will do for views...

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.200
and then I don't feel so alone.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600
{CLAIRE}
I thought I'd be working with other <i>trained</i> actors.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480
{CLAIRE}
Instead, I got these morons.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.400
OW, FUCK! I- I'M NOT PLAYING!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.800

"Will I ever see my son again?"

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.880
[RHODA]
"I'll tell you what's up
if ya pay me five bucks."

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.400
[JAIME]
No, don't look at the camera, and please,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.720
<i>STICK TO THE SCRIPT!</i>

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.520
But I want my character to get paid!

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.160
{RIMMER}
No, Madame Minurva was not
in the original screenplay.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920
It was a little creative liberty
I took with the script.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.400
Just a way to help her feel included,
'cause she's letting us use the building for free.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.520
Of course, none of this is making its way
into the final cut of my movie.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.440
"Yeah, and give me your [gnikcuf] wallet too!"

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.240
[RIMMER]
All right, good, that's awesome, that's great.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.960
Put the gun down.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.760
Let's move on to our next scene,
where the demons are having an "anal fit"...

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.200
...sorry, an "<i>annual</i> fit".

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.160
{RHODA}
Sure, I've been suspicious of my husband.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.720
But what man doesn't have
a little pep in his step?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.680
A little prance when he pees?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.460
Sure, he might be a little curious...

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.040
(STRANGER)
<b>HEY! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!</b>

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.600
(RICKY)
Oh well, I'm just curious!

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.920
{RHODA}
Hell, even <i>I'm</i> a little curious...

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.000
...curious if my husband suck dick.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.400
[THADDEUS]
"I want to help you find your son, ma'am,
but you need to be more specific."

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.200
[MAZEY]
"What part of 'young, brilliant, and stunning'
doesn't compute for you, officer?"

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.700
"I've shown you what he looks like.
Now get out there and find him!"

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.100
[JAIME]
No, cut!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.820
I- I think this guy needs rehab!

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.200
[KADEN]
Ughhhh, I have a name, dick!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.740
I- I always thought it was "Kaden".

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.360
Ughhhh, I need a toilet.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000
I've got Tums in my purse!

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.080
[THADDEUS]
OH SHIT!

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.600
[JAIME]
<b>GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!</b>

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.700
{JAIME}
Kaden's always been messier than my enemas,
but lately, he just sucks.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.000
{JAIME}
Kaden's always been messier than my enemas,
but lately, he just <i>sucks</i>.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.300
And he keeps chugging from
this bottle labeled "Gatoraid".

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.400
{KADEN}
No, I'm not doing good.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.000
I've never felt this feeling before.
I think it's called "guilt".

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.320
{KADEN MOANS}

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.440
I've been taking bribes all last week from Mr. Ball
to not tell Alex he's doing this all for nothing.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.900
(KADEN)
You're a piece of shit, you know that?

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.700
{KADEN}
I- I can't even look him in the eyes
knowing his dreams won't be coming true.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.900
(RIMMER)
When those Balls give me my career,
I'm gonna give you a better life,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.600
and you'll never have to drink "Gatoraid" again.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000
[RIMMER]
Fuck it, I'll film this thing myself.
Are you guys ready?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.160
[ELYSE]
Wait, what scene are we doing?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't know.

Oh my God, I told you we had the right place!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.360
Oh my God! Lindy! Shafty!

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.890

I'm so sorry, we're- we're just really big fans of Elyse.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.600
Okay, hold on.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.760
We make videos too!

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.960
Shut up, you're making us look stupid!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.120
How did you find us here?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.640
The Wrench Challenge video, you dummy!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.920

The street signs were behind you!

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.840
[JAIME]
God damn it, we doxxed ourselves!

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.130
No, you started a freaking revolution!
Everyone is wrenching now!

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.000
As soon as we saw your address,
we just had to drive out here for some selfies!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.800
Can we take more?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.360
Of course!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.280
Oh, thank you!

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160
[CLAIRE]
Hi, yeah, we're in the middle of a scene here!

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.280
And she isn't that special.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.600
You finally have a queer person
in one of your classes!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.160
Now that your address is leaked, I'm surprised
the support group isn't here to skin you!

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.520
Hold on, what support group?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.480
Oh [tihs], you don't know!

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.760
Well, it's a group of women that connect every week
over how much they hate you.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760
That's impossible, no one would hate me!

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.800
Well most of them are former students...

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.840
...and your ex-girlfriend.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.280
[RIMMER]
Wait, Carol? I thought we ended on good terms.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.800
Maybe, but she said, "Alex [gnikcuf] blows,
and I wish I never sat on his face."

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.280
Wait, hold on, time out,
You're a part of this group too, Linda?!

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.480
Well, I'm <i>sorry</i> it's hard for me to make friends.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.760

Consequences?! Bitch, you're
the only one of us who got out of here rich.

Oh, boohoo! The only thing
worse than a wheelchair is a <i>child!</i>

Fuck you, Mom! I don't even wanna be here.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.960

Ladies, this is what Alex wants:
us turning on each other.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.760
{(CAROL)}
After my breakdown from dating Alex, I had a realization:
I could help others online find inner peace too.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.400
"The only person who needs to like you..."

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.440
"...is yourself."

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.480
(CAROL)
But seriously, Karen.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.800
Nobody likes you.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.160
Eat my wheels, Carol.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.140
I would, but then we'd be stuck with you.

Remember when her mom died?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.200
That was good!

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.480
I remember those cookies that she put all of that work into
just for them to taste like ass!

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.000
I don't even know Karen, but I know she sucks!

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.400
Look at her go!

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.320
Oh, they <i>did</i> taste like ass!

Yeah, they sounded pretty gross.
