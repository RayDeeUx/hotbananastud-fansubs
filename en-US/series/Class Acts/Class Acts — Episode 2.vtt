00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
(LILLIAN BALL)
We need you to make our son's movie.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.160
(PRESTON BALL)
Make my movie, make my movie!!

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.200
(RIMMER)
You want me to pull all of this off without a budget?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.400
(VICTOR BALL)
You'll find a way. You can't afford not to.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000
(RIMMER)
You know I'm <i>literally</i> about to drive to Los Angeles.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.900
(JAIME)
That's what I was hoping for.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.320
(JAIME + RIMMER (SINGING))
—and nothing can stop us now!

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.360
(KADEN)
Make a sound and you're dead.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.400
[RIMMER]
Why are you doing this, Kaden?
You were always such a good student.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.240
[KADEN]
Are you serious?!

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.720
[KADEN]
You left me on the side of the road to die!
I had to burn all my clothes so I wouldn't freeze!

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.040
[RIMMER]
Kaden, where did you find my backseat gun?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.160
[JAIME]
Wait, why do you have a gun?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.680
[RIMMER]
Jaime, every problem we've ever had
could have been solved with a gun.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.040
SHUT <i>UP,</i> and give me everything you got!

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.700
[RIMMER]
Jokes on you, asswipe!
We have nothing to lose.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.080
[JAIME]
Okay, <i>now</i> we have nothing to lose.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.960
[JAIME]
Okay, <i>NOW</i> we have nothing to lose.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.650
[KADEN]
Later, buttholes.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.800
Tell me how to make it go!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.760
[RIMMER]
Fuck you, I'm not telling you [tihs]!

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.350
If you don't make this piece of
shit go in the next 5 seconds–

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.700
<i>{b o o m}</i>

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.920
<i>{B O O M}</i>

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.400
[RIMMER]
Look, we're gonna need to work together
if we're gonna pull off my dream.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.160
[JAIME]
<i>Our</i> dream.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.080
[RIMMER]
Mhm, yep.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250
[KADEN]
You two seem to have forgotten that
I have a gun aimed at your thesbians.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.040
[RIMMER + JAIME]
Oh, yeah.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.720
[WAITER]
You ladies need somethin'?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.200
[RIMMER]
Help.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.120
[JAIME]
Waffles.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.320
Yes, waffles would be a huge <i>help</i>.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.260
[WAITER]
Okay then!

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.400
[JAIME]
Kaden, what do you want from us?
There's literally nothing we can give you.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.760
That you want.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520
[KADEN]
You could rob this place for me.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.000
[RIMMER]
I <i>could've</i> left you in that prison
to rot, but I thought to myself,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.400
"Mr. Rimmer, this is a boy
that could turn his life around,"

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
but I was wrong.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.960
You're such a nugget of [tihs],
even <i>Karen</i> didn't want you.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.720
[JAIME]
What he means is, you could really
make something of yourself here.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.330
I mean, you were just trying to rob us for cash,
well, how about you work <i>with</i> us for a <i>future?</i>

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.800
I never thought about that word.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.640
Which one, "work" or "future"?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.320
Exactly.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.500
[RIMMER]
Well, Jaime and I were on our way to
Los Angeles to make a movie about—

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.960
[KADEN GESTURES TO STOP]

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.560
[KADEN]
I already heard you describing this [gnikcuf]
gay script when I was hiding in the backseat.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.840
(KADEN)
This script is [kcuf]in' gay.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.960
[RIMMER]
With Jaime's cinematic skills, and your incel rage,
and my good looks, we could be unstop—

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.280
[WAITER]
That's them, officer! The naked ones!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.600
[WAITER]
Shoot them before they shoot each other!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.080
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
Drop the gun and put your hands behind your head!

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.780
[JAIME]
You better be a fuckin' stripper.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.600
[SHOT FIRED]

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.280
[KADEN]
He's not!

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.480
[RIMMER]
Jokes on you, Officer Dumbass!
Two-thirds of us aren't getting nothin' out of this.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.750
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
All right, little fella!
These perverts are off to get reamed!

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.260
[WAITER]
Good.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.400
[RIMMER]
Damn it, officer, you are arresting one
of America's greatest acting teachers!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.560
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
Then who's the gay guy and
the gayer guy you're with?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.880
[RIMMER]
They're my assistants.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.800
[JAIME]
I would never suck your—

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.280
<i>{p u n c h}</i>

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.560
[JAIME]
Augh! Yep, real acting can't be
taught by just one little dreamer.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
You know, I used to be an actor myself.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.600
[KADEN]
And my parents are aristocrats, so when I get my inheritance,
you're gonna change your little tune about me.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360
[RIMMER]
Why are you <i>not</i> in LA right now?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.280
[KADEN]
Guys, I just remembered my parents died.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.240
[KADEN]
<i>That means I have diplomatic immunity, dick!</i>

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.200
[RIMMER]
You know, cop characters are in high demand right now.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.040
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
I'm a cop.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.840
[KADEN]
I can have anyone legally assassinated!

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.200
[RIMMER]
You know, we all auditioned for cop characters,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.000
[RIMMER]
but Hollywood said we weren't bald, buff, or black enough.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.840
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
I'm all three of those!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.360
[RIMMER]
Why don't you come with us to LA?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.360
[RIMMER]
I can teach you acting skills that'll
make you "Leonardo De-crap-your-pants".

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.000
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
I was supposed to take you to jail.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440
[JAIME]
For what, being nude?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
For having a gun, mother[rekcuf]!

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500
[JAIME]
I– it's a prop gun.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.600
[SHOT FIRED]

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.840
[JAIME]
Movie magic!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.140
[OFFICER THADDEUS]
That felt real to me!

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.760
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
So we were off to the
land of copyrighted dreams.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.310
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
This is where stars are made.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.050
[RIMMER]
Okay, first things first, if I'm gonna teach this class,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.640
[RIMMER]
then we're gonna need clothings.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.100
[THADDEUS]
I know a spot that sells clothes!

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.280
[JAIME]
What are you doing?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.760
[RIMMER]
Getting our movie made, how about that?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.700
[KADEN]
No actor will ever involve themselves
in that script. It's crap.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000
[RIMMER]
Uh, not only will they involve themselves with it,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.720
[RIMMER]
they're gonna pay for the privilege.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.000
[RIMMER]
What- what do I teach, guys?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.100
[JAIME + KADEN]
Screen acting.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.920
[RIMMER]
Mhm! And what is a screen acting class

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.250
[RIMMER]
besides putting people on camera
and doing scenes from different movies?

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.680
[RIMMER]
What if we recreated every scene from the same movie?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.400
[RIMMER]
This movie.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.560
[JAIME]
Where were <i>you</i> keeping that?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.520
[THADDEUS]
I've got your wardrobe, actors!

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.000
[RIMMER]
That's great, now we need students.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.440
[KADEN]
People who are serious about acting.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.040
[JAIME]
And desperate. Very desperate.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.910
Well, I know where to find
the best actors in Hollywood.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.700
[RIMMER]
No, these people aren't actors!
They're hepatitis-havers turning tricks for tips!

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.040
[JAIME]
All right. Listen up, failures, if you wanna
take acting seriously, you better join our class.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.600
[KADEN]
If you don't, I can have you
all <i>legally assassinated!</i>

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.040
[RIMMER]
We're not doing this storyline.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.680
[THADDEUS]
I know it seems fake,
but these guys are the real deal.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.300
They taught me movie magic!

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.160
[JAIME]
Whoa, whoa, Thaddy, no.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.400
[RIMMER]
You there! Star Wars elf!

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.440
Yeah, you!

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.500
Now you look like an actor
who knows how to commit to the bit!

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.120
I know you could do so much better than... this.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.400
And I could teach you the way.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.520
[JAIME]
Did you have that flyer on you when you were naked?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.800
[RIMMER]
I always have a flyer on me.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.600
Or in me.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.240
[KADEN]
This is fuckin' pointless. Let's go.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.760
[JAIME]
This place is dirtier than my asshole.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.300
[RIMMER]
Stupid.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.370
[THADDEUS]
If it's any consolation,
I think you're brilliant.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.650
[STAR WARS ELF]
Do you really think so?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.000
[THADDEUS]
Augh, you ruined it!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.520
["MARILYN MONROE"]
Did she just break character?!

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.360
["SPIDER MAN"]
She did!

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.240
["SPIDER MAN"]
She broke character and broke our oath!

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.880
["MARILYN MONROE"]
Let's snap her neck!

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.390
[THADDEUS]
Woah, woah, woah, string bean.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.060
[THADDEUS]
Run, robot!

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.810
[STAR WARS ELF]
Wait!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.350
[STAR WARS ELF]
I changed my mind.
I wanna join your class.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.450
[RIMMER]
Uh– well, just in time, 'cause
we're having a special right now:

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.040
Free admission for anyone who lets us
live with them for a few days.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.520
[STAR WARS ELF]
I– I might know a place at my other...

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.400
...my <i>only</i> job.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.760
[UNNAMED MALE]
God damn it, Claire! Where have you been?

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.000
You're late for the dinner rush!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.800
[CLAIRE]
Yeah I could tell your hands
are really tied without me.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.960
[CLAIRE]
Yeah I could tell your hands
are really <i>tied</i> without me.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.240
[UNNAMED MALE]
Where <i>were</i> you, bitch?!

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.200
[CLAIRE]
Networking.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.720
Found some actors in need of housing.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.920
[UNNAMED MALE]
In Los Angeles? You're shittin' me.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.720
[CLAIRE]
Frank, I get a goddamn free
acting class if we house them.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.700
[FRANK]
Damn it, Claire, that is a <i>very</i> good deal.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.120
Any openings for a 15-to-21-year-old leading male?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.160
[RIMMER]
We're full.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.280
{RIMMER}
Sorry, that mother[rekcuf] is not real.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.560
{RIMMER}
Have you seen him blink?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.160
[CLAIRE]
You can sleep here.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.520
[KADEN]
There's nothing to sleep on.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.720
[CLAIRE]
There's a floor.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.440
[JAIME]
Eh, I've slept on worse.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.680
[JAIME]
Can I drill a hole in this?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.600
[CLAIRE]
What for?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.800
[JAIME]
The [kcuf] do you think?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.650
[RIMMER]
You're going to hell.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.040
[RIMMER]
First things first, I'm gonna need the two of you
to go out and find more students to recruit.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.920
[FRANK]
I thought you didn't have space! :ꓷ

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.640
[RIMMER]
Meanwhile, I'll find a place to shoot this movie.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.800
[CLAIRE]
What movie?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.200
[RIMMER]
...to teach this class.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.080
[JAIME]
Welcome to Hollywood, bitch, where you're gonna
be a failure unless you join <i>our</i> screen acting class!

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.240
[JAIME]
Come on, learn to act like
somebody who gives a shit!

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.040
[JAIME]
<i>I won't let you give up on your dreams!</i>

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.200
[KADEN]
Yo. You want some class?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.080
[JAIME]
Join our class or eat my ass!

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.120
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
It's hard to find a place to live in this town,
but it's even harder to find a place to work.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.160
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
Luckily, the Lord decided to
give me both on the same day.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.360
{RHODA MAY}
I'm a God's Warrior.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.800
{RHODA MAY}
And God wants straight people.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.380
{RHODA MAY}
You like girls, bitch?!

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.680
{RHODA MAY}
Everybody likes what they supposed to like!

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.280
{UNNAMED CHURCHGOER}
I've been a member of Rhoda's church for years.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.640
{UNNAMED CHURCHGOER}
I still suck [kcid].

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.000
{UNNAMED CHURCHGOER}
Most gays actually use it as a meetup spot.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.120
[RHODA MAY]
♬ Before each time I masturbate, ♬

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.400
[RHODA MAY]
♬ I first thank God that I am straight. ♬

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.680
[RHODA MAY]
♬ And if I ever lose my way, ♬

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.200

[RICKY MAY]
Hold! Looks like we got ourselves
a newbie in the back!

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.200
[RICKY MAY]
What's your name, kiddo?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.520
Uh, I'm Alex Rimmer, and I'm "he/him".

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.500
[RHODA MAY]
Gender's not in the Bible
and it won't be in here.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.120
[RICKY MAY]
Yay!

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.240
[JAIME]
Listen, you miserable [kcuf],

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.680
[JAIME]
I am gonna make you famous
<i>one way or ANOTHER!</i>

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.200
[JAIME]
You want an Oscar?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.240
[JAIME]
Hey, do you want an Oscar?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.980
[THADDEUS]
Gotcha!

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.600
JAIME: [YELPS]
KADEN: FUCK!

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.520
Why did you ditch me?

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.360
[KADEN]
We didn't ditch you.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.980
[JAIME]
We thought "Spider Man" killed you.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.750
He tried...

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.300
[JAIME + KADEN]
...acting class?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.160
I thought you'd never ask!

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.880
[RHODA MAY]
Heterosexuals are the future.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.160
[RIMMER]
That's what I've been saying!

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.520
[RHODA MAY]
And the past.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.680
[RICKY MAY]
Gays are just a blip in time.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.440
Aren't you?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.240
[RHODA MAY]
Isn't my husband <i>what?</i>

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.040
[RIMMER]
...okay...

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.300
Look, I love your venue, and I wanted
to know if I could use it for free.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.480
[RIMMER]
...so is that a yes?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.800
[RHODA MAY]
My grandmother gave me this black box theater!

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.900
[RICKY MAY]
And he wants it for free?!

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.160
[RICKY MAY]
What are you planning on doing in her grandmother's black box?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.400
I'm an acting teacher, and it has been my life's
mission to teach people how to act.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.000
...straight.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.980
[RHODA MAY]
Why don't you just teach them how to <i>be</i> straight?

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.590
Well, because most actors are a lost cause.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.320
But I can help teach them how to fit
into a straight society, right?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.440
And with your beautiful venue, I think we can
straighten up Hollywood just a little bit.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.800
{RIMMER}
I wasn't lying, I was <i>acting</i>.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.360
{RIMMER}
And [kcuf] you, whose side are you on?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.410
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
I didn't sacrifice everything
just to be [kcuf]ing honest.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.640
Guys, I found a venue that'll
let us teach our class!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.800
[RIMMER]
Hello?

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.000
[RIMMER BANGS ON POT]

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.960
[RIMMER]
Money!

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.400
[JAIME]
What's up?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.280
[RIMMER]
There we go.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.440
Guys, I found a venue to do this [tihs].

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.800
<i>Please</i> tell me you found me some students.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.440
[JAIME]
Maybe.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.200
[KADEN]
Probably not.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.000
[CLAIRE]
This class better be worth what you promised,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.500
or you struggling actors will be struggling on the streets.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.220
[LOUD PERSISTENT RINGING]

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.320
[RIMMER]
I think you have a customer.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.360
[CLAIRE]
I don't notice the customers until my shift starts.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.220
[RIMMER]
What the <i>FUCK</i> do you want,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.920
[RIMMER]
What the <i>FUCK</i> do you want, you youngsters?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.000
[VICTOR BALL]
We're here to check on production progression.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.470
[RIMMER]
Produc... well, uh, we started...

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.550
[VICTOR BALL]
Ah, that's good to hear.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.720
[RIMMER]
How did you Balls find me here?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.400
[LILLIAN BALL]
We planted a bug in your bowl.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.190
[RIMMER]
Uh, I <i>think</i> I would know if there was a bug in my

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.960
[RIMMER]
[Kcuf] me!

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.600
[LILLIAN BALL]
Our son wants his movie finished by... "soon".

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.360
[VICTOR BALL]
Have you started casting this piece of shit?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.160
[RIMMER]
Casting?

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.920
By this time tomorrow, I guarantee
you I will have the finest actors

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.200
L.A. has to offer sitting right in front of me.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.160
Not just appearing in your son's piece
of shit movie, but <i>paying</i> to be in it.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.520
[LILLIAN BALL]
Paying, you say?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.600
[VICTOR BALL]
Paying equals profits.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.520
[RIMMER]
Thank you so much for letting me use this space.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.920
[RHODA MAY]
But first, there are some things you
need to know about this building.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.960
[RHODA MAY]
The toilet's clogged.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
[RHODA MAY]
This alley is haunted.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.160
[RHODA MAY]
We don't even know where this goes.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.360
[RHODA MAY]
And this chair farts.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.680
[RHODA MAY]
You still want this place?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.920
[RIMMER]
Hell yeah, I do. This place is the [tihs]!

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.800
[RHODA MAY]
<i>Holy</i> [tihs].

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.610
[JAIME]
This is bull[tihs].

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.720
[RIMMER]
How's the crowd out there, guys?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.960
Angelinos can be vicious.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.770
[JAIME]
Rimmer, five people showed up.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.870
[RIMMER]
<i>Five</i> people?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.200
[JAIME]
I am so sorry.

Five people showed up.
