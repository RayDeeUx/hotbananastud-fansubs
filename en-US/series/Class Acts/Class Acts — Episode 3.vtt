00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
Alright, now I want us to go around the circle,
and I want us each to say our names,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.280
and then something about ours-
something interesting about yourselves,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.760
'cause none of us know each other yet,
so none of us care.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.400
My name is Claire Atlas.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.240
I have been acting since my first ultrasound, and I
am only two projects away from being SAG eligible.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.040
{UNNAMED ELDERLY WOMAN}
Poor thing! I started sagging way later in life.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.440
Hi, I'm Elyse.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.320
And I'm not <i>just</i> an influencer.
I'm a vlogger, makeup guru, and ASMR-tist.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.600
[EVERYONE (unenthusiastically)]
wow, wow...

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.080
And now I'm in this class, 'cause my agent thinks
I'm ready to start doing something substantial.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.440
This is my nana Mazey.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.320
She's always wanted to take an acting... Hey.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480
...always wanted to take an acting class,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.310
and we figured out she doesn't
have much time left, so...

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.960
[VIDEO GAMING NOISES]

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200
...so I signed her up.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200
I also sell weed.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.080
[STIFLED LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.160
[RIMMER]
Watch it, we got a cop in this class.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.400
[THADDEUS]
Oh, laws don't apply to the stage.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.840
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.440
[RIMMER]
No, they don't.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.920
{THADDEUS}
There are good cops, and there are bad cops.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.720
{THADDEUS}
I'm a cool cop.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.360
{THADDEUS}
And pretty soon, a cool actor.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.840
I'm Mr. Rimmer, and it is my job
to make the camera love all of you.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.320
All of you.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.280
And so by the end of the semester,
you might not like me that much,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000
but God damn it, I'll make sure you can act like it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.320
Now, I want you all to look up there and say "hi"
to the two best stage hands this side of the 405.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.880
I'm Jaime. I'll be teaching you how to suck less.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.200
Or more, if that's what you're into.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.840
i'm kaden.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.020
i'm doing lights.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.120
They get better, don't worry.
Now, first order of business.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.600
I'm gonna teach each of you your typecast... s.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.880
Ugh. I'm always the hot one.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.120
Hey, you are only as hot as
other people think you are.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.040
That's what typecasting is:
what do other people see when they see you?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.080
They see a hot girl.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.520
Well it's not all about you, dear, is it,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.500
because everyone gets typecast, alright?
And I don't want anyone here to feel singled out,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.780
so why don't we start with
going around and saying our pronouns,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200
because we might have a transgender in this class.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.920
Yeah, we're not fucking doing that.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.480
Yes, and that is ok– that's alright with me,
because I don't see gender anyway.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.360
Well, I'm a girl.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.640
And that is beautiful.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.720
Okay, everyone, this is a safe space, okay?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.040
I don't see penises or vaginas,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.920
or race,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.120
or age,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.850
or, um...

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.350
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.360
...what do they call you guys again?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.200
Gingers.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.780
Actually, that's offensive now.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.730
Oh...

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.640
...my bad, sorry.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.240
When can we skedaddle?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.680
Stop.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200
When I say "skedaddle", how about that?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.360
This is a very exclusive class, guys.
It's worth every minute, regardless of how many you have left.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240
No, this class is not exclusive.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.200
It is e– there were five [__] slots left,
and you guys filled 'em.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.620
I had to turned down Timothy "Sham-a-lay".

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.960
[POTENTIALLY GENUINE LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.840
Oh, haha, he said "slots".
Grow <i>up</i>, everyone.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840
{RIMMER}
I forgot the cop's name.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.250

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.630
Now, most screen acting classes have
you do different scenes from different movies.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.600
In this class, we're doing
every scene from <i>this</i> movie.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.480
A movie so bad, I guarantee
none of you have heard of it.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600
[ELYSE]
Oh, so it's like we're making a movie.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.130
No, not at all, it's nothing like that, actually.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.200
Get the [kcuf] out.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.200
Sit down, I was acting.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.440
{ELYSE}
Yeah, like a dick.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.480
Alright, now I want you all to take a script,
skim it over, let me know what you think.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.600
Yes, I know it's trash, but that's the challenge, right?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.160
Seeing if you could sell this trash
as if it's as good as you.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.040
[MAZEY]
But it's worse than me, and I'm dogshit!

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.640
[DESMOND]
Language.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.760
[CLAIRE]
No, the witch is right.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.400
[CLAIRE]
This is clearly written by some damaged incel who–

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.760
[PRESTON BALL]
–spends the night with two hot girl demons

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.560
[PRESTON BALL]
who are secretly trying to trap him
and kill him with sex and danger.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.040
[LILLIAN BALL]
Why are the hot demons trying to...

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.400
[PRESTON BALL]
Hot <i>girl</i> demons, Mom.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.800
[LILLIAN BALL]
...right.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840
[LILLIAN BALL]
Why are they trying to force themselves upon him?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.680
[PRESTON BALL]
Because he ran out of chocolate!

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.600
[VICTOR BALL]
Which he...

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.480
[PRESTON BALL]
He was using to control them,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.100
[PRESTON BALL]
because they're females!

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.080
[VICTOR BALL]
[Kcuf].

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.520
[PRESTON BALL]
I've read you this script, like, five times!

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.760
[LILLIAN BALL]
Yes, but... this time, we're listening.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
{LILLIAN BALL}
and shitting our pants.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.670
[VICTOR BALL]
Son, do you think this is a <i>good</i> movie?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.320
[PRESTON BALL]
I think it will carry on our family's name.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.900
[VICTOR BALL]
Yes.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.340
[VICTOR BALL]
Straight to hell.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.220

If Bezos finds out that hot trash
is from <i>my</i> bloodline,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.520
[VICTOR BALL]
I'm positively fucked.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.440

And whoever plays the main character
better be a fucking pro!

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.080
Lucky Desmond, you get to be the main character.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.760
[DESMOND]
SHIT!

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.120
Yes, take that and use it!
And then, uh, Claire and the other one,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.080
You two are gonna be the hot girl demons.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.320

Cool! This is gonna be fun.

All this work to get grouped
in with a goddamn influencer.

Something tells me I got what it takes.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.440
Nice, use that.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040
And Mazey, you're gonna be Desmond's mom.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.240
[MAZEY]
I know his mom, and I'm not getting fat!

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.200
Alright, now why don't we
go ahead and just partner up.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.520
[THADDEUS]
Oh, but there's five of us.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.960
Perfect!

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.210

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.980

No, no, no.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.000

Don't bother him, Grandma.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.440
[MAZEY]
Why not? You're bothering me.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.000

[THADDEUS SLOWLY REGRETS HIS DECISIONS]

[CLAIRE]
I'd just like to confirm that
no one will see this footage.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.480

This material could end our
careers before they start.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.090

this room will ever see this movie.

and study these scenes with your partner.

I need this dialogue off book by next class.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.800
And this is the exact moment when you leave.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.250
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
Do I feel bad for using
these people to make a movie?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.880
[RIMMER (V.O.)]
Do I feel bad for taking their money
for a class that isn't real? No.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.640
{RIMMER}
'Cause if they're getting out
of it what they paid for,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.640
{RIMMER}
I mean, isn't that as real as
Hollywood ever needs to be?

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.920
We did it, fellas.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.120
We found everything we need
to make this movie happen.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.840
We got a set.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.790
We got a cast.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.960

some pretty fuckin' weird people.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.520
{KADEN}
you know, a lot of them wanna
be famous for what they do,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.560
{KADEN}
and a lot of them wanna
be famous for who they are.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.120
{KADEN}
and a lot of them are willing to hurt themselves,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.480
{KADEN}
and everyone around them,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.920
{KADEN}

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.200
{KADEN}
