00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:07.048
[HEARTBEAT]

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.387
[MR. DUTTON]
We're cutting your funding, Bryce.

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.480
[BRYCE]
I'm sorry, you want to try that again in English?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.766
[MR. DUTTON]
We allotted you those funds
to build three children's hospitals.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.920
Instead you built TEN PRISONS!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.860
[BRYCE]
They're cheaper!

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.300
And kids just suck!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.240
[MR. DUTTON]
I'm sorry Bryce, but we are cutting

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.420
your

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420
FUNDING!!

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.740
[BRYCE]
I heard you the first time, I just didn't agree.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.620
Now unless you have anything positive to say

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.220
about my looks...

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.740
I don't see any reason for this to continue.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.550
[DONOVAN]
Ma'am...

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.300
We have the charity meeting in 30.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.000
[BRYCE]
You hear that?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.660
I goddamn do charity!

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.160
[MR. DUTTON]
Yeah, for people with what?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.000
Insider info?!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.840
[DONOVAN]
Cancer.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.460
[MR. DUTTON]
Oh...

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.880
Well...

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.540
Still...

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.600
You're not getting another CENT from my company!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.680
Try anything and you'll see me in court!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.280
[BRYCE]
Donovan, our investor has just crossed a line.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.120
[MR. DUTTON]
What are you doing?!

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.440
Call him off me, you monster!

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.920
[BRYCE]
No, you see, a monster would
NOT tell your wife and kids

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.540
where your body can be found tonight.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.240
But because I'm such a caring person,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.260
your kids can rest easy knowing
their daddy never abandoned them.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.380
[MR. DUTTON]
No! Wait! Please!

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.780
HAVE A HEART!

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.640
[BRYCE]
I do have a heart, Mr. Dutton...

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.380
and it is about as

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.529
large as your

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:33.668
PENIS.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.460
Get me cleaned up, Donovan.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.980
I wanna look like I give a
shit at that cancer thing.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.800
[ANTHONY PADILLA]
She's one of THE most influential CEOs
in all of American history...

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.660
...but is she more than a corporate sex icon?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.640
[BRYCE]
ACTIVATE THE BEYONCÉ!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.760
[ANTHONY PADILLA]
The internet is absolutely
obsessed with this woman.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.820
There isn't a tikker or a tokker
who doesn't wish to one day be

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.050
Bryce Tankthrust.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.640
[BRYCE CACKLES]

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.240
And she might not be YOUR president...

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.040
but she certainly was America's.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.827
[BRYCE]
How's this for a stimulus package, America?

00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:13.041
[BRYCE]
...I said it on tape!

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.300
[JOE BIDEN]
Show the tape, put it on your website.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.820
[BRYCE]
Oh, you mean eatmyassjoe.org?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.200
[BRYCE]
Stay tuned, poor people!

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.650
[BRYCE LAUGHS]

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.560
[ANTHONY PADILLA]
And let's not forget that she just
got married to horny terrorist

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.400
Bobby Worst.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.520
The evil-weds were recently spotted
honeymooning at North Korean Pride...

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:32.340
And rumor has it, a literal heart has started
growing inside that empty void of a chest.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.220
Will she retain that evil
edge that's gotten her so far...

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.800
or will she now start going SOFT?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.060
[BRYCE]
I'm cutting your funding :D

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.960
[THE CRAB LADY]
I'm... sorry?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.100
[THE CRAB GUY]
You said you wanted to help us.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.780
[BRYCE]
Well, I didn't think you'd live this long.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.700
[THE CRAB GUY]
I'm sorry, you thought we were DYING?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.380
[BRYCE]
Look, I don't know how cancer works.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.040
[THE CRAB LADY]
Ma'am...

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.600
We don't have cancer.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.980
This is a charity for people
born June through July 22nd.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.800
[THE CRAB GUY]
Your money goes to the mental health of Cancers

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.640
who are bullied simply for being a crab.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.980
[BRYCE]
Wait, hold on, are you fucking kidding me?

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.440
I've been dumpin' cash into this
glory hole for how many years?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.640
[THE CRAB GUY]
It's been 9 months, ma'am.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.680
[BRYCE]
Shut the fuck up you crab, that was rhetorical.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.020
Look, with the money I'm
saving with whatever this is,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.300
you people should be happy to
know that I'm going to build my

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.800
11TH PRISON!

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.970
[THE CRAB LADY]
What happened to you in your
childhood to make you such...

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.930
a monster?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.060
[BRYCE]
What happened in your
childhood that made you so poor?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.520
[THE CRAB LADY]
No no, I'm actually asking...

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.260
Why are you like this?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.940
[BRYCE]
What, you mean "good with my money"?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.800
I started learning frugality
the very day I was born...

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.260
[DOCTOR]
The head's too big, ma'am!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.300
[TAMMY]
Well what do you want me to do about it?

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.860
[DOCTOR]
We're gonna need to perform a C-section.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.600
[TAMMY]
What's that gonna set me back?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.040
[DOCTOR]
Ma'am, you NEED this.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.660
[TAMMY]
Well that means expensive...

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.640
[BABY WAILS]

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.744
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
My mother always knew the
value in pinching a penny...

00:03:50.744 --> 00:03:53.984
She was a con artist, you see,
and a damn good one.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:57.680
By the time I was 10, she decided it was...

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.520
[TAMMY]
Time you finally grew up!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.140
Today, I'm gonna teach you
the Double Diva Diversion!

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.220
[THE CRAB GUY]
The Diva...

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.420
[BRYCE]
The DOUBLE Diva

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.440
[TAMMY]
Diversion, yes!

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.560
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
Her mother and her performed it,
and now she and I got to.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.620
[TAMMY GIGGLES]

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.240
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
The maneuver consisted of one
person distracting an individual

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.960
often by flirting, while the
other person robs them blind.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.580
I don't know why she called
it the "Double" Diva Diversion

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.920
'cause it was apparent only one
of us was allowed to BE the diva.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.540
She was the beautiful distraction,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.360
and I was the petty thief
who lived in her shadow.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.500
Of course, I justified it as a means to live;
we were just keeping the lights on, that's all!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.020
But what I would have given just
to be that distraction just for once...

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.680
...just to have men look at me
the way they looked at her...

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.580
I was willing to get that validation
from anyone willing to give it to me.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.720
[BRYCE]
Who is that?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.220
[BOBBY]
JUST THROW IT!

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.960
[MELONY]
That's Bobby, he's new.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.520
I heard he goes to therapy

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.960
and he doesn't have parents.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.540
[BOBBY]
OW WE'RE NOT PLAYING FRISBEE! :ᗡ

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.460
[MELONY]
Yeah, someone pooped his Valentine's box...

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.300
[STACEY]
So far, no one likes him.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.604
[BRYCE]
Good.

00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:02.850
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
It was obvious he needed to be saved

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.460
far more than I needed the validation,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.520
[BRYCE]
but...

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.000
I don't know,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.600
sometimes I wonder who was saving who that day.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.160
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
Even in that moment, I knew I was living through
the pinnacle of ten-year-old rom-coms.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.600
That is, of course, until my friends
showed up and screwed the pooch.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.340
[MELONY]
Ew, I told you they were friends.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.440
[BOBBY]
Why don't you shut up, Melony?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.060
[MELONY]
You shut up, you ass-haver!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.440
[BRYCE]
Melony, you have an ass too.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.940
[MELONY]
You would know, pervert!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.560
[STACEY]
Ew, you're a pervert?!

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.020
[MELONY]
Ew, gross!

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.180
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
We were perfect for each other...

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.880
and soon, he became the only
thought that occupied my

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.080
—oh shit, I forgot about this.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.000
[BRYCE GETS STRANGLED]

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.583
[TAMMY]
I can tell you're getting distracted.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:48.540
You're not focusing on that school shit, are you?

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.500
[BRYCE]
Of course not, mother,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.960
you know I detest learning about this world.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.304
[TAMMY]
Good. Because the world does not look
out for girls like you and me Brycey...

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:56.460
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
As the bitch droned on,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.364
all I could think about was Bobby...

00:05:58.364 --> 00:05:58.980
[BOBBY, DRESSED AS TAMMY]
...you're not a beauty...

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.600
[BOBBY, DRESSED AS TAMMY]
...you're not a great beauty like me!

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.000
What are you gonna do when you grow up?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.225
You gotta use your brains!

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:04.900
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
...and the more I thought about
him, the more I felt this

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.265
strange throbbing feeling
inside my little chest.

00:06:08.965 --> 00:06:12.120
In that moment, I knew
my heart was his.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.200
[BRYCE STABS HERSELF]

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.280
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
It was the most alive that little
goblin-girl had ever felt...

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.900
...for about 20 minutes.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.260
[BOBBY]
You don't look so good.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.340
[BRYCE]
I guess that's love...

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.900
[BOBBY]
No, that's not love; we gotta find
a doctor and put this back in you.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.980
[BRYCE]
Yeah, on whose dime?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.960
And what am I supposed to do?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.180
Just come home and say, "Hey Mom, I fell in love
with a boy you don't know and now I ripped my

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.460
heart out for the motherfucker and now I
need to get it sewn back into my chest

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.360
immediately before I die!"

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.600
[TAMMY]
You did WHAT to your new uniform?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.820
[BOBBY]
Did you not hear a word your daughter just said?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.920
She needs a hospital!

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.380
[TAMMY]
No, what she needs is to
stay away from boys like you!

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.000
[BOBBY]
eeumphMMPPH!! >:(

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.080
[BRYCE]
Just go home, Bobby.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.520
[BOBBY]
I don't have a home...

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.640
Yeah, or parents...

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.140
I don't...

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.260
I...

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.920
...have nothing.

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:12.866
[TAMMY]
Awwwwwww...

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.808
[FITCHELL HORNBORN]
Who is THIS lovely can of hairspray?

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:40.549
[DONOVAN]
This is, uh... my...

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:42.000
...girlfriend.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.134
[FITCHELL HORNBORN]
Fitchell Hornborn. Big dick, bigger phones.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.592
[BRYCE]
Oh, I know who you are, Mr. Hornborn.

00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:51.378
[FITCHELL HORNBORN]
You keep bringing this bitch around,
I might just give you a raise!

00:14:51.378 --> 00:14:54.400
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
And that's how I learned
to get by 90% of the corporate world.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.038
[TAMMY]
You better be dead, or you will be!

00:14:56.038 --> 00:14:59.308
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
The thought of making money legitimately
never crossed my mind till that moment.

00:14:59.308 --> 00:15:00.825
[LOCAL TWINK]
Excuse me, what the hell
do you think you're doing?!

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:02.644
[TAMMY]
HEY! HEY!

00:15:02.644 --> 00:15:05.454
You're too ugly to touch my d– sister!

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:06.575
[LOCAL TWINK GASPS]

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:10.000
[BRYCE]
You know, I ran the numbers, and we
could actually be making more money

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.584
if we went and got jobs.

00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:15.320
[TAMMY]
Did you know how shitty it would be
to work for someone else?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.816
[BRYCE]
Well, you gotta start
somewhere... and who knows?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.668
Maybe one day, we'll be the ones
people answer to, mother.

00:15:22.668 --> 00:15:26.220
[TAMMY]
Jobs are for suckers.
They never let women run anything.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.310
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
I knew right away that was a lie...

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.360
'Cause someone was letting her
run that damn mouth.

00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:31.552
[DELORIO]
Attention!

00:15:31.552 --> 00:15:35.236
Mr. Hornborn would like to offer you
a promotion today at noon.

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:37.361
Congratulations, Donovan.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.269
[BRYCE]
Well, holy shit, look at you
climbing up that ladder!

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.920
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
And that ladder soon became my obsession.

00:15:48.127 --> 00:15:51.480
[BRYCE]
...and on the other side, we have
penises and boners, and THAT'S why

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.668
we only have two genders!

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:56.382
[DONOVAN]
Wow, you're really progressive;
maybe I should get a Bible.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.290
[BRYCE]
You know, Donovan, I...

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.480
I think it's time I gave you
something I've been holding on to...

00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:05.752
[DONOVAN]
Thank you!

00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:08.548
I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:11.294
[BRYCE]
Well, y– you know... this is my way of s—

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.537
You have opened my eyes

00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:14.956
to a new way of living,

00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:16.569
a better way of living,

00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:17.600
of making a—

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.728
of EARNING a living and I—

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.127
[DONOVAN]
What the FUCK is this?

00:16:22.677 --> 00:16:24.370
[BRYCE]
In my head, that was going
to take you longer to open.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.279
[DONOVAN]
Did you steal this from my house?

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.868
[BRYCE]
Well, worse. I actually was the
diversion while that was stolen.

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:32.246
[DONOVAN]
You're friends with "Tacky Tammy"?

00:16:32.246 --> 00:16:34.801
[BRYCE]
Eh, worse. I came out of "Tacky Tammy".

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:38.001
[DONOVAN]
Wait, so you mean ALL of this is just payback
because I wouldn't give your mom a free phone?

00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:41.591
[BRYCE]
Well, it's a RESULT of that,
but it's not the whole caboodle!

00:16:41.591 --> 00:16:46.205
And how DARE you think my mom's CLEVER
enough to pull off a heist THAT complicated!

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.223
I FUCKED YOU!

00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.574
[DONOVAN]
Yeah, well, I thought I was being
fucked by a decent church girl!

00:16:49.574 --> 00:16:53.221
[BRYCE]
Church girls don't NEED to be fucked
because they ALREADY are!

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.656
And BESIDES, I don't need church to be DECENT.

00:16:55.656 --> 00:16:58.228
I'm doing the decent thing now, AREN'T I?

00:16:58.228 --> 00:16:58.890
[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.000
[DONOVAN]
What else are you lying about?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.296
[BRYCE]
Oh, don't go making me out to be some
kind of LIAR just 'cause I don't tell the truth.

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.157
[DONOVAN]
Are you even WITH the Jesus and God Church?

00:17:11.157 --> 00:17:13.601
[BRYCE]
I'm not even with Jesus OR God!

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.715
[DONOVAN]
Were you ever even with me?

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.464
[BRYCE]
Of course I was– I– I am with you, Donovan.

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:26.839
And you really have taught me
a better way of living...

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.489
[DONOVAN SLIPS AND SCREAMS]

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:30.980
[BRYCE]
...I just don't see a future
without you in it at this point.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.743
This is where you say... something, anything...

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:37.032
Donovan...

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:39.032
Don—

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.379
DONOVAN!!

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:45.686
Donovan!

00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:47.286

00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:51.178

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.134

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.163

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:04.080
dead oh my god you are so dead

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.730
you are one of the most dead people i've ever...

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.863
[STRANGER 1]
Hey! Is there someone over there?!

00:18:06.863 --> 00:18:08.482
[STRANGER 2]
I think there's someone over there!

00:18:08.482 --> 00:18:09.880
[BRYCE]
NO!!!

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.000
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
Right about this point, I was shittin' my tights.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.634
I mean, what was I supposed to do?
How was I supposed to break this to my mother?

00:18:15.634 --> 00:18:20.980
[BRYCE]
Long story short: I hiked all the way back—on foot—
from the bottom of a cliff a man fell off of—

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.580
who I've been secretly dating
behind your back—his head popped off!

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.300
And while I'm trying not to blame myself
for his death, I know the police probably will!

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.008
[TAMMY]
You did WHAT to your new shoes?

00:18:31.008 --> 00:18:35.401
[BRYCE]
Mother, listen. To what. I'm saying!
This life of crime is getting us into seriously hot water!

00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.966
[TAMMY]
NO!!!

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:42.760
What you did going behind my BACK got us into
hot water! And this "life of crime" that you

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.760
so belittle is the ONLY thing we have to go on,
and that's the only thing we're ever gonna HAVE!

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:50.120
WHAT THE FUCK

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.891
do you want, officer?

00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:55.349
[LOCAL TWINK]
That's her. That's the one that called me ugly.

00:18:55.765 --> 00:18:57.878
[OFFICER]
Is this true, ma'am?

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.940
[TAMMY]
Officer, look at him.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.885
Ow! My daughter actually killed someone tonight,

00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.330
and you're arresting me?!

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.830
Ow! I don't like it like that, stop it!

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.131
[ANCHOR]
Shoplifter and petty thief
Tammy Tankthrust has been arrested tonight...

00:19:09.847 --> 00:19:13.582
...spotted by a local twink who claims:
"I won't let anyone be rude to me again!"

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.893
[TAMMY ON TV]
I really screwed up Brycey, and I'm sorry.

00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:19.946
I was a terrible mother.

00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:24.565
I should have had us rob
WAY prettier people, way RICHER people.

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:28.131
We should have killed ALL the witnesses, left nobody.

00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:32.305
But now here I am, suffering the
consequences of being too nice.

00:19:32.305 --> 00:19:35.078
Don't let your heart get any weaker.

00:19:35.563 --> 00:19:37.186
...I think I'm stuck.

00:19:37.586 --> 00:19:40.305
[BRYCE'S VOICE]
To whom it may concern,

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.409
my name is Bryce Tankthrust.

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:47.063
It has come to my attention that a position has
recently been made available at your company.

00:19:47.063 --> 00:19:50.999
I believe I have what it takes to fill
not just the void in your office,

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:52.927
but the one in your heart.

00:19:52.927 --> 00:19:57.334
I am a woman of solid ethics
and I intend to be a valuable asset

00:19:57.334 --> 00:20:00.940
to your company through
hard work and good judgment.

OH, SHIT! WE MISSED THE EPISODE!

Don't cry...

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:12.285
I heard she's bringing a live version
of this show to these cities!

00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:13.485
