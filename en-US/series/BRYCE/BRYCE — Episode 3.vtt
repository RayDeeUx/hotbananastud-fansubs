You're getting soft.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.650
And The Board will see you at 8PM to discuss
the consequences of your behavior.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.900
[BRYCE (RECAP)]
The Board wants to see me tonight, Bobby.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.600
And this time, they mean business.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
[TAMMY (RECAP)]
It's a Double Diva Diversion, my dear!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.700
[BRYCE (RECAP)]
I'm not gonna rope another person
back into that world of crime.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.660
[BOBBY (RECAP)]
What if there was a way where you didn't
have to get another person involved?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.900
[GLORIA (RECAP)]
I was wrong about you!

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.200
You was using him for murder!

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500
[BRYCE (RECAP)]
Donovan, we now have a new objective.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.585
Eliminate all obstacles
that get in the way.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:30.695
[BRYCE]
...and that's about

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.340
[BRYCE]
two-thirds of my backstory.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.975
[RECEPTIONIST]
...riveting.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.000
If you're finished, The Board will see you now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.695
[BRYCE]
Alright.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:43.300
Well boys, this is it.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.400
[BOBBY]
If anything happens to you in there...

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.200
[BRYCE]
Nothing is going to happen in there, Bobby.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.200
[KISSES + WINKS]

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450
[RECEPTIONIST]
If you're quite done,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.550
they're not having a picnic.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.800
[BRYCE]
Oh.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.900
[BRYCE]
Oh. It would be.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.992

Bryce Tankthrust.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Do you know why we've summoned you here today?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
[BRYCE]
No, but I got a good fucking hunch
you're about to tell me.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200
[BOARD MEMBER]
Ever since you married that piece of shit,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.100
a heart has been growing in your chest.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.400
[BRYCE]
I thought you'd be happy for me.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.000
I no longer have to seek out constant donors.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.095
[BOARD MEMBER]
I can give two shits about your health!

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.850
You're no longer the heartless bitch

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.900
we fell in love with thirty years ago.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.000
[SERENA LITELL]
Move my six o'clock to seven, and my seven to three.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.520
[BOBBY]
But what do I tell your three o'clock?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.000
[SERENA]
Tell them they're shit out of luck.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.200
[BRYCE]
Well, you are shit out of olives,
I could tell you that much.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
[SERENA]
The hell's the new girl doing at my house?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600
[BRYCE]
Gettin' toasted and staying hungry, apparently.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.700
[SERENA]
You're humping up my husband, aren't ya, hussy?!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.000
[BRYCE]
No, I have standards.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.040
Although with an uggo muggo like his,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.200
I'm sure he must have a plump penile, huh?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.350
[SERENA]
I knew you'd never had a future at this company.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.350

[BOBBY]
Serena, wait. L– Let's talk this out.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.320
[SERENA]
There's nothing to talk about.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.000
Some people just weren't meant to live.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[GUN FAILS TO FIRE]

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.500
[BOBBY]
You know, it really was a mistake hiring both of us.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400
[BRYCE]
You know, Serena, I think it's time
your company found itself

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.200
You know, Serena, I think it's time
your company found itself
a capable CEO.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.300
[SERENA]
You're looking at her, bitch.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.500
[BRYCE]
No, I'm looking at a coward

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.300
who needs her hubby
to be the face of her brand.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.100
[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.850
And his face will be a lot more malleable

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.600
if he doesn't have you to fall back on.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.200
Don't you see, Serena?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.100
Removing you from the equation
will be my checkmate move, dear.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.400
[SERENA]
You'll never get away with killing me.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.600

Was it really worth dying for her?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.700

My sacrifice would mean...

[DONOVAN]
...her salvation.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.200
[BRYCE]
I've said a lot of things
to get me where I am now,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.500
but nothing's helped me more
than these two solid American words:

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:35.830
[BRYCE (FLASHBACK, TO GLORIA)]
"I'm sorry."

I'm sorry for betraying you.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.480

Truth is, I am who I am because of you.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.450

And I am sorry for not recognizing
the presence of another bad bitch

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.210
[BRYCE (FLASHBACK)]
who's been staring me
in the face all these years.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.020

We need a contingency plan!

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.000
[BRYCE (V.O.)]
In fact, my entire contingency plan has been

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.800

Y'know, Gloria, I asked you to build me a sex bot.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.100
Instead, you built something that
understood me more than anyone I ever knew.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.200

there is no such thing as the top.
