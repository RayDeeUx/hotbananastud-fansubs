00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.570
[BRYCE (V.O.) (RECAP)]
Not many people know how I climbed
to my coveted position of power,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.280
and can you believe I let these
cursed Cancers in on my backstory?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.000
I told them about how Bobby got ripped

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.140
from my arms by my con artist mother,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.400
who taught me the "Double Diva Diversion".

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.900
This little technique made me
cross paths with the man I soon loved...

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.220
Until he was a man I soon killed.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.700
Every person I relied on for happiness
has let me down in one avenue or another.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.650
I soon learned that the only
person I can rely on is myself.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.579
[BRYCE]
And that's basically a recap of the story
I just finished telling you people.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.940
[BRYCE SLAMS TABLE]
SIMPLETONS!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.079
[THE CRAB LADY]
We're listening.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.039
[BRYCE]
"wE'rE LiStEn" Yeah?
What was the last thing I said?

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.460
You know what?
To hell with you pricks.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.400
I hope you Crabs get crabs.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
[THE CRAB GUY]
Ma'am, you're already cutting our funding.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.339
What more do you want from us?

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.739
[BRYCE]
To feel heard.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.739
ME.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.239
NOT

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.639
NOT MY

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.939
NOT MY MONEY!

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.280
[THE CRAB LADY]
I'm sorry, but maybe you carved
a life for yourself where

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
the only thing people
WANT to hear about...

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.400
IS your money.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.900
[BRYCE]
Donovan, let's give these Crabs

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
Donovan, let's give these Crabs
enough holes to give us trypophobia.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
[THE CRAB GUY]
Fuck, I spent my whole life doing this?!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.000
[HELICOPTER FLIES OVER]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200
[DONOVAN]
What the hell is that?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.520
[BRYCE]
Oh, shit!

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.500
H-hi, hi! Can I help you?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.559
[PAGE]
Your presence is requested by The Board.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.300
[BRYCE]
And what does The Board want with me?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.220
[PAGE]
They're worried your new heart is
rendering you too weak to be a leader.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.400
[BRYCE]
Weak?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.860
Honey, I was about to pump
these fuckers full of more iron

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.320
than a bowl of Cheerios. :D

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.840
[PAGE]
You clearly haven't been
watching the news.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.739
[REPORTER]
It's a grisly goddamn scene
tonight here as the police

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.539
uncover the body of CEO Mark Dutton
from the LA River.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.039
I interviewed his wife earlier
this evening. This is all she gave me.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.900
[MRS. DUTTON]
I'm just thankful the killer
told us where to find the body.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.940
At least I know he wasn't cheating tonight.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.800
[REPORTER]
I guess some killers really DO have a heart.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.540
[PAGE]
You're getting soft.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.740
And The Board will see
you at 8PM to discuss

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.700
the consequences of your behavior.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.740
[THE CRAB GUY]
Someone's in trouble...

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.960
[PAGE]
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.220
[DONOVAN]
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.100
[PAGE UNVEILS DYNAMITE]

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.475
[EVERYONE SCATTERS]

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:20.600
[STOCK TALKER]
Tankthrust stocks are in the shitter, folks!
And I do not think she's gonna come back...

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.250
[BOBBY]
Shit, that's her!
Look busy, twinks,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.419
let's rack 'em and pack 'em.
This is not a drill!

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:26.160
[BRYCE]
Move.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.720
[BOBBY]
Good morning, my tender cutlet!

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.980
[BRYCE]
Morning. Bobby, look, I told you if you're
gonna have sex bottoms over while I'm gone

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.879
to at least make sure they're domesticated.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.600
[BOBBY]
They ARE domesticated, dear.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.200
[BRYCE]
Bullshit, they're hardly housebroken!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.260
There's a turd under the bed!

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.900
[BOBBY]
All right, bottoms, get the fuck out.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.860
Out!

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.740
Out, God damn it!

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.525
What seems to be troubling you,
my little piece of hog shit?

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.010
[BRYCE]
The board wants to
see me tonight, Bobby.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.000
And this time, they mean business.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.420
[BOBBY]
And? I thought those
cocksuckers were afraid of you.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.500
[BRYCE]
Maybe before I fucked this country over, sure, but...

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.540
Ever since I botched that presidency,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.340
I wouldn't put a corporate
mutiny past these fuckers.

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.680
[BOBBY]
You're a fighter, Bryce.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.840
And you always have been since
your very first day on the job.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.625
[FITCHELL (FLASHBACK)]
So it's your very first day on the job,
and you might be wondering, "What am I doing here?"

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.200
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.050
[FITCHELL (V.O.)]
At the Callco family, you'll
have opportunities to learn

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.600
exciting new skills, such as...

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.700
Faxing and filing on cutting-edge technology!

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.130
Answering phones!

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.300
And all good Callco family members stay in shape.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.940
You don't just want to look good at
your job, you gotta be good at it too!

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.239
So, welcome aboard, and I hope you do your best!

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.239
'Cause you never know where this career might take you.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.350
[BRYCE'S PROMISE]
"I promise to make an honest living
for the rest of my life, and no matter

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.875
the challenges ahead of me, I won't be my
mother, I will not resort to petty theft

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.280
and violence to get what I want.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.600
I vow to one day be a woman of wealth,
and to have made every cent of that fortune

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.505
through hard work and good ethics!"

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.275
[DELORIO SLAMS COFFEE CUP]

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:13.375
[DELORIO]
Good morning!

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:14.750
[BRYCE]
Uh, g-good morning! I–

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.500
[DELORIO]
You do understand that in about... twenty seconds,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.350
Mr. Hornborn's gonna be walking through that door.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.850
[BRYCE]
In twenty– he's gonna– tha– he's early today!

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.959
[DELORIO]
He's never early, we're always late. I assume
you have his agenda printed and his latte milked?

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.125
[BRYCE]
His a– la– uhh... shi– oh fuck, uh,
I– uh, give me, like, five minutes–

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.280
[DELORIO]
I figured as much.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.000
Good morning, sir! Everything is
ready for you in the conference room.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.125
[FITCHELL]
Oh, good. Thankfully I have my coffee.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.700
It is with a heavy heart that we must say
goodbye to a beloved member of the Callco family.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.250
Donovan, I always said hiking was basically
suicide, and if your death has any meaning,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.380
let it be that I was right.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.325
And let us never be in nature again!

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.100
And now, let us welcome the newest member
of our Callco Family.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.850
Her name is Bryce, but let's be nice,
girls can have boy names too.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
[BRYCE]
Okay, I look forward to working with each of y–

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[FITCHELL]
Next thing on the docket!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.900
The bank was closed yesterday, so this month
your paychecks will have to be in cash.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.280
I assume you can each find your own.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.500
[BRYCE (V.O.)]
I took one look at what sat in that
envelope and nearly tied my own tubes!

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.160
I mean, I spent two goddamn weeks serving in that
shit palace, and all they thought to pay me was

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.900
[BRYCE]
40 FUCKING DOLLARS, ARE YOU KIDdinG mE—

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.660
[BRYCE (FLASHBACK)]
How long is this gonna last me?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.120
[PAUL (FLASHBACK)]
It all depends on your ability to
avoid stress, anger, depression...

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.950
[BRYCE (V.O.)]
I knew I needed to speak to the one
person who could help me.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.230
[BRYCE]
Hi! I've noticed my paycheck was pure shit
and I've come to help you out on your error.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.160
[MR. THOMAS]
That is how much employees
like you make in this decade.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.750
[BRYCE]
What do you mean, "employees like me"?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.150
[MR. THOMAS]
The peniley challenged. Science has
shown that a third of a person's self-worth

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.450
is in his penis.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.350
[BRYCE]
Hold on, you're telling me your job is math

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.730
and even you can't add up HOW FUCKED THIS IS?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.460
[MR. THOMAS]
Hey, don't fight me, fight science.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.200
[BRYCE]
Well, science isn't sexist.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.860
[MR. THOMAS]
Women can make just as much as men at this company.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.280
I mean, Janice makes more than I do.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.750
Hey, Janice!

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.300
[JANICE]
Yes, Mr. Thomas?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.800
[MR. THOMAS]
Tell her how much you get paid.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.039
[JANICE]
A lot.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.039
[BRYCE]
Yeah, and I got two guesses why.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.730
Look, I want money without having to mutilate myself

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.940
like this balloon animal, you bearded prick!

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.160
[MR. THOMAS]
Hold on, I've got a pamphlet for this.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.460
"Emotional Women in the Workplace and You"...

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.180
"Step 1: try throwing chocolate..."

00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:40.250
[BRYCE]
YOU MOTHER—

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.900
—FUCK!

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.160
That is GOOD.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.860
[YOUNG BRYCE]
Oh wow!

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.160
I really grew up to be a girl who sells
her beliefs for a chocolate bar.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.900
[BRYCE]
You are too young to know
what you're talking about.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.830
And besides, it's a Carmelo.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.900
[YOUNG BRYCE]
Remember how your predecessor got
promoted for doing so much less?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.100
[BRYCE]
Okay, you can shut the hell up
now, please, thank you.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.550
[YOUNG BRYCE]
This is sad.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.600
Looks like puberty's gonna destroy my backbone.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.100
[BRYCE]
Shut up,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.900
you shut up,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.500
shUT UPP!! >:(

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.100
Oh, God...

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.650
[GLORIA]
Wow.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.820
You look like you just
saw your first paycheck.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.500
[BRYCE]
Yeah. I wish I hadn't.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.460
[GLORIA]
I'm Gloria. I'm the head engineer.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.340
[BRYCE]
I'm Bryce. I have a heart condition.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.500
[GLORIA]
Yeah, I can tell.
You know, if you need help,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.720
I know a thing or two about cardiology.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.470
[BRYCE]
As a phone... engineer?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.960
[GLORIA]
Honey, I only work here for the money.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.500
[BRYCE]
Oh.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.500
[GLORIA]
My real passion is the human body.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.700
[BRYCE]
Ah, you're a pervert.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.800
[GLORIA]
I'm a scientist.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.900
[BRYCE]
Most of them are.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.400
[GLORIA]
Well, if that blood puppet keeps giving you shit,
stop by my office. I'll give it a look-see.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.940
[BRYCE]
Okay, you're not just trying to
give my tits a look-see, are you?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.140
[GLORIA]
Girl, what tits?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.479
[BRYCE]
Touché.

00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:00.400
[BRYCE (V.O.)]
Little did my tits know that my problems
would soon be going from sour to rancid.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.000
[BRYCE]
Hi! Hi! Can I help you?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.720
[DIANE]
Well, according to your bank account, I doubt it.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.800
[BRYCE]
Okay, I'm sorry, who the hell are you supposed to be?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.940
[DIANE]
The name's Diane.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.100
[BRYCE]
Mhm, of course it is.

00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:15.920
[DIANE]
And you would be...

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.759
Addison Adderall?

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.950
[BRYCE]
She's my mother, and dead.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.500
[DIANE]
Well, could you run this by
the cemetery next time you visit?

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.300
[BRYCE]
You're evicting me.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.400
[DIANE]
Well the bank is, but I like to think I am.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.160
[BRYCE'S HEART BUCKLES]

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.900
[BRYCE]
You are a fucking witch.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.039
[DIANE]
A witch that is giving you 30 days to vacate.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.700
Diane out.

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.219
[BRYCE (V.O.)]
I think it's safe to say at this point,

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.900
my tits had an idea something was wrong.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.650
[TAMMY]
Jesus, you look like SHIT, Brycey!

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.519
[BRYCE]
Oh, this is just a little bit of stress,
mother, nothing my heart can't handle...

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.920
[TAMMY]
I'm not talking about your heart,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.700
I'm talking about that outfit!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.280
Blue ain't your color, honey.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.420
[BRYCE]
Okay, I did not come here to get insulted,
mother. I came here for advice.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.300
[TAMMY]
When you could've been working out...

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.520
[BRYCE]
Okay, mother. How did you make a living
before using me as a tool?

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.500
[TAMMY]
It's a Double Diva Diversion, my dear!

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.640
Before you, I used my roommate.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.720
And now, I use my prison wife.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.600
[BRYCE]
You don't have a prison wife, mother.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.230
[TAMMY]
Then how did they get your pearls?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.000
[BRYCE]
SHIT!

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.100
Goddamn, my fucking face...

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.050
[DELORIO]
The face of a drug addict.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.590
You're on that marijuana, aren't you?

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.040
[BRYCE]
Get the fuck out of here,
this is a woman's reception area!

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.380
[DELORIO]
Then what are YOU doing here?

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.320
[BRYCE]
Oh honey, get the fuck out, now!

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.850
Out, motherFUCKER!

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.180
HOooooaUGHHH >_<

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.180
I hate working.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.120
I hate this job so much.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.210
[GLORIA]
Wow, you look worse than you did yesterday!

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.550
[BRYCE]
Oh, thank you!

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.450
[GLORIA]
Yeah, I think it's time I took you to my workshop.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.480
Welcome to my Temple of Technology,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.080
AKA the birthplace of the Porta-5000.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.080
[BRYCE]
Holy moly, so compact, it'll fit in my purse!

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.480
[GLORIA]
And the next model gon' fit in your ass!

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.980
[BRYCE]
So this is where you design all these tech marvels.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.160
[GLORIA]
Among a few other...

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.360
side projects.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.760
[SIMIAN]
Hello. My name is Sim—

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.420
[BRYCE]
WHAT THE

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.865
[BRYCE PUNCHES SIMIAN]
FUCK?!

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.990
[GLORIA]
What the hell is wrong with you?
Do you know how expensive that thing is,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.440
you dumb bitch?!

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.740
[SIMIAN]
She appears to be having a cardiac arrest.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.540
[GLORIA]
Well, no shit.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.040
[BRYCE]
I need to go to a

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.940
[BRYCE]
I need to go to a hoOOOSPItaL!

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.620
[GLORIA]
Simian, get momma the prototype.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.080
I've always dreamt of a world where
heart transplants didn't require murder.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.750
[BRYCE]
Oh, that's– I don't think that's how heart transplants work.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.080
[GLORIA]
Then where are hospitals getting all them real hearts at?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.900
[BRYCE]
Oh, shit.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.500
[GLORIA]
Mmm.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.480
[BRYCE]
So you're telling me this thing can
actually be installed in my body,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.100
and pump blood?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.150
[GLORIA]
We about to find the fuck out.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.600

[SIMIAN]
Scalpel.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.860
[GLORIA]
Now I'mma warn ya, this gon hurt like hell.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.100

Oh, please.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.440
[BRYCE STABS HERSELF]

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.640
[GLORIA]
God damn it, bitch.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.420
[BRYCE]
Alright, do it quickly.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.600
[GLORIA]
Simian, go hold the door.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.760
[SIMIAN]
We are committing a crime.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.560

Hey! The fuck's happening in there?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.520
[GLORIA]
Oooo, you did a number on this one.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.400
[BRYCE]
Oh believe me, it did a number on me.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.320
[DELORIO]
Hey, I– I know what marijuana sounds like.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.640
[BRYCE]
Put it in!

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.920
[GLORIA]
Welp, here goes nothing.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.050
[BRYCE]
Yes, I heard you. Why you knocking so much?

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.200
[DELORIO]
Who's in here with you?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.100
[BRYCE]
Well, I don't know what you're talking about,
I've just been in here doing alone things.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.840
[DELORIO]
Listen, bitch, oka–

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.760
[ALARM]
ARRIVING.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.060
[DELORIO]
Shit!

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.900
Places, people! This is not a drill!
Serena Litell is landing!

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.860
[BRYCE]
I'm sorry, who?

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.680
[DELORIO]
The owner.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.320
[BRYCE]
I thought Mr. Hornborn was the–

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.260
[DELORIO]
What are you doing?
Get in line, look presentable.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.180
[FITCHELL]
Be honest, how do I look?

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.300
[DELORIO]
Like a man who has a–
a very lucky wife, sir.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.700
Shit. Those are her heels.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.730
Look alive, people!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.520
[FITCHELL]
Sweetheart! You're back from Thailand early!

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.640
[SERENA]
I heard one of our employees died
and I came to disaster control.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.400
It's not our fault, is it?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.800
[FITCHELL]
No, of course not, dear.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.500
[SERENA]
Oh, thank God for that.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.440
Back to work, everybody.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.240
[BRYCE]
Hi, Serena Litell. I'm Bryce Tankth–

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:30.540
[SERENA]
Why is it talking to me and not helping
my assistant bring in my bags?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.100
[BRYCE]
It... would be very happy to.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.500
W– Where– where is your assistant?

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.700
[BOBBY]
Oh good, you must be the new girl.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.380
Take these to Ms. Litell's office and be DELICATE.
And then I've written you down a tailor

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.100
so you can get that dress resized,
how about that. Got it?

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.000
[SERENA]
Come, Bobby. Business matters await.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.400
[BRYCE]
Bobby.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.240
Where have you been?

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:28.670
[BOBBY]
You mean ever since that orphanage
your mother threw me into?

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.000
[BOBBY]
I spent my entire childhood in that kiddie clink.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.000
[BOBBY (V.O.)]
And on my 18th birthday, oh, they wasted
no time in throwing me right back out

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.080
on the streets they found me.

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:50.400
And then I was saved by a gang of horny
criminals who called themselves

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.500
"The Worst People Alive".

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.940
We lived off of lube, leather, and a life of crime.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.990
Until that evening when one of our hits went south.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.700
You see, we didn't expect the
occupant to be home that night.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.980
[SERENA]
Get out of my house, you perverts!

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.820
[BOBBY (V.O.)]
She let me live as long as I pledged to be

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.440
her "unpaid intern till one of us dies".

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.00
Turns out being toxic in the streets ain't that different

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.700
from being toxic in the workplace.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.420
[BRYCE]
Damn it, so you don't have money.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.080
Which is why I came here to– I–

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.780
efughhH.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.100
I'm getting evicted this month, Bobby, and
I need help trying to keep a roof over my head.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.030
[BOBBY]
Didn't you and your mother always do
that "Double Diva Dildo" shit?

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.819
[BRYCE]
"Diversion". And no, I'm not going
back to a life of crime, Bobby.

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:16.600
I'm making my money ethically now.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.050
[BOBBY]
Well, I don't know that word.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.520
[BRYCE]
And even if I WERE to go back to
the "Double Diva Diversion", I– I–

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.500
I'm not going to rope another person
back into that world of crime.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.000
[BOBBY]
What if there was a way where you didn't
have to get another person involved?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.519
[BRYCE]
Gloria! I have something else you can
build me that'll help fix my little heart.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.880
[GLORIA]
Wow. You really miss him, don't you?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.600
[BRYCE]
I– Yes, more than anything, and–

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600
[GLORIA]
You realize how much it's gonna
cost you to build a sex bot?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.699
[BRYCE]
Whatever it's worth, I'll pay double.

00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:50.880
I just want one night with him first, and
the very next morning, I promise

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.880
you'll have however much you desire.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.420
[GLORIA]
If you have so much money, why you
working here as a fuckin' receptionist?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.840
[BRYCE]
It was Donovan's money.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.160
He said in his will that it was only to be accessed if
a capable enough sex bot in his image were to be built.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.199
So what's it gonna be, Gloria?

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.250
The clock is ticking.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.160
[DONOVAN]
Donovan reporting for duty.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.200
[BRYCE]
He's perfect.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.950
[DONOVAN]
Why do you humans take so much time
preparing food, when all you do

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.240
is turn it into shit?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.700
[BRYCE]
Because humans are gross,
and God is worse. He made us.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.640
Me personally, I hate food.
I think I'm allergic to it.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.000
Every time I eat it, I get fat.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.160
[DONOVAN]
Is this a promise you made to yourself?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.320
[BRYCE]
Oh yeah, every morning I say
that shit, can you believe it?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.000
[DONOVAN]
If these are your beliefs,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.200
then why are you teaching me how to steal?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.480
[BRYCE]
We live in a world where it
takes money to make money, Donovan.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.130
[DONOVAN]
I do not understand.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.400
[BRYCE]
The odds aren't exactly in my favor
right now. In times like these,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.320
it's okay to break the rules a little bit.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.000
[DONOVAN]
I was built to be a sex object.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.840
[BRYCE]
No, you were built to make me happy.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.440
I just need you to hack into a certain
someone's computer and bump my salary

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.600
just enough for me to pay my rent.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.100
[MR. THOMAS]
Closing time.

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:31.700
Good night, Ramon.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.500
[DONOVAN, IMITATING RAMON]
Good night, sir. Say hello to
the wife and children for me.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.280
[MR. THOMAS]
Good night, new lady.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.440

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.440
but I didn't know you were SLOW.

Where's my wife?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.100
[BRYCE]
Why, she's in here.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.110
With us. :D

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.750

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS WOMAN
BY GOING TO HER LIVE SHOW!

Only an IDIOT would buy
tickets to see a woman

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.300 align:right position:100% line:87.5%
that you can see for free
on the damn interweb!

Why am I still here?
Someone milk me a FUCKING latte.
